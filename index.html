                    <p>Water is one of the three basic elemental types along with Fire and Grass, which constitute the three starter Pokémon. This creates a simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to new players. Water is the most common type with over 100 Pokémon, which are based on a wide variety of fish and other sea-dwelling creatures.

This creates a simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to new players. Fire types are notoriously rare in the early stages of the games so choosing the Fire variation starter is often a plus.
